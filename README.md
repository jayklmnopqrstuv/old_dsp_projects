#### A. Camera Motion Estimation by Feature Masking and Kalman Filter for Video Stabilization
https://github.com/jayklmnopqrstuv/old_dsp_projects/tree/main/camera_motion_filtering.  
This project explores the use of masking and Kalman filter to stabilize shaky motion during recording process.

#### B. Background Noise Reduction Based on Wiener Suppression using a Priori Signal-to-Noise Ratio Estimate
https://github.com/jayklmnopqrstuv/old_dsp_projects/tree/main/noise_suppresion_recording.    
This study focuses on the suppression of background noise in a mono-channel audio file using spectral analysis.
